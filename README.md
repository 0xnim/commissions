# What is this? 
This is a repository containing contracts people have commissioned me to code.
Every contract is fully explained with comments, error messages, and easy syntax. Someone who has no expierence with coding should be able to understand the logic behind my contracts. So check em out!

Feel free to deploy some of these and test them yourself! All contracts are useable from an etherscan interface.

You are free use these contracts yourself, but make sure to follow the rules of the license I put in each one of them. There is a TL;DR of the license at the top of every contract.

# How to commission a contract:
